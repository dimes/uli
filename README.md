# Uli

An easy-to-use command line tool for fetching real-time sports information 

## Motivation

I recently switch to DuckDuckGo for my internet searches. One thing I miss about good is it's ability to show me today's sports games. Uli solves this problem for me by putting that information into my terminal.

## Usage

You can also alias Uli commands to make them even shorter by adding lines like this to your bashrc or zshrc files:

    alias nhl='uli nhl'
    alias nyr='uli nhl nyr'
